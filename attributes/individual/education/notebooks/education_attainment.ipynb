In other words, the most likely absolved education for a student is the group that they have had to complete to enter that level.\n",

This group could be interpreted as not educated at all, or, since most people will finish primary education (due to compulsory learning laws) as having completed at most primary school, but since the defined semantics is that we have no idea about this group, that would be imposing assumptions on the data, which we want to minimize.
